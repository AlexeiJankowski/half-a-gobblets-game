## Kinda Gobblets

___
#### Console version of Gobblets game, written using C# Language (.Net 6.0). 
##### It's my version of the game, because I don't want to write functionality for moving figures on the board (I needed this code just to understand how to write the game to write it in another language I don't know - Dart. Sounds weird, but... hmmm... Yeah! It, definitely, is.)
___
It contains 
- at least one bug, which I cannot fix :)
